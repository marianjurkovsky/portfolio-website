          <p>This product is a responsive web app I designed for a course project where the brief was to create a recipe app. Easy Web Chef offers easy-to-follow recipes, enhanced with cooking process pictures. The goal of this app is also to
            complete
            the
            user experience by providing proper beverage pairing, and second day meal as this information often lacks overall satisfaction with our meal consumption.
            I was the UI/UX designer for this project. The name of this app expresses easy maneuvering over culinary arts. After initial exploration, I created user persona, user flow, user flow diagrams, low- fidelity wireframes progressed gradually
            to
            high fidelity. After user testing, I build improved high-fidelity digital screens and mockups. I worked on this project from March to May 2021.</p>

        <h3><span>Research</span></h3>


        <p>After an initial competitive analysis to gain an overview of other companies, defining their strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities, I conducted Interviews with 3 users to learn more about the cooking process and the needs or
          frustrations. By creating qualitative research, I discover what features users are considering necessary in the cooking recipe app and also what would be helpful to make their experience more satisfying.</p>

        <p>What users were saying:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Regarding the cooking process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>“I am often not sure about proper measurements, cooking temperature, or how to
            change meal size.”
          </span></p>
        <p><span>“I can’t tell if the dish taste or looks right.”
          </span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Need help to choose the recipe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>“I search by basic ingredients and usually decide based on reviews and pictures”
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><span>“I look mostly for not complicated recipes with short preparation time.”
          </span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Want a more comprehensive recipe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>“I like video recipes; it makes it easier to follow and be confident in the process.”
          </span></p>
        <p><span>“It will be great to use leftovers again.”</span></p>

        <h3><span>Ideation</span></h3>

        <p>To further understand and empathize with the users, I created three user personas to represent users' needs and frustrations and synthesize data obtained from research.
        </p>
        <p>Building on this I chose my primary user stories from the list included in the brief:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When I open the app to search for a recipe, I want to be able to start searching for what I want to prepare so that I can save time and effort.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>- A menu that is broken down into well- known food categories.
          </span></p>
        <p><span>- Filtering search option to define and speed what user is looking for.
          </span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When I try the recipe I like, I want to save it and share it, so I can easily access it next time and enjoy it with others.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>- Create User Account Page to save favorite recipes.
          </span></p>
        <p><span>- Create recipe sharing option, social media, mail, print.
          </span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When going thru recipes, I want to see images of food I am preparing, so I can visualize and better understand the cooking process.
            Images showing step by step process of preparation for easy following
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>- Images showing step by step process of preparation for easy following.
          </span></p>
        <p><span>- Final product picture or video presentation.</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>As a person cooking for myself or others, I want to choose how many people I cook so that I can avoid waste of food and money.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>- Include option to manipulate on serving size.
          </span></p>

        <ul>
          <li>As a person who relies on user's opinion, I want to read other people reactions to the recipe, so I can get help to decide to choose one.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>- Create recipe rating options, comments – review section.
          </span></p>

        <h3><span>Wireframe</span></h3>
        <p>Crazy 8’s methodology generated a lot of design ideas. I sketched 8 different low-fidelity solutions for the same design problem in 8 minutes. Screens slightly changed during the evolution of the project, but this technique founded the
          first
          visual interpretation of my ideas.</p>

        <p>Once I finished sketching, I conducted a usability test to evaluate the key concepts and identify usability issues with the prototype. After analyzing the feedback I received, I refined the wireframes into digitalized higher fidelity.
          I continued to refine with the help of feedback from my mentor until I had a set of final high-fidelity screens.</p>

        <h3><span>Design</span></h3>


        <p>Wireframes were getting ready to step out from black and white composition. For that, I have created 2 visual moods, one more rustic with an early day expression and another warm, relaxing, and spicey. I chose at the end a warmer tone
          mood board</p>

        <p>Style Guide creation ensures to maintain the standard, and consistency of design reflected warm tones of my mood board.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>As a person who works in the hospitality industry, I often look to improve user experience dealing with food and beverage. Adding simple features like beverage pairing, nutrition facts, or a second-day meal creates a product that would
            serve the user more effectively. Importantly, it would complete his overall satisfaction with the product I am offering.
